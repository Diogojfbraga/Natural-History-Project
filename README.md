# Natural History Catalogue Management System

The **Natural History Catalogue Management System** is a web-based application designed with the aim to help explorers, researchers, and enthusiasts involved in the preservation of biodiversity to document their specimens findings. While this database is mainly focused on the Natural History Museum and their assets, this database could be expanded to worldwide linked organizations where other specimens found and stored could be mapped and documented.

The project utilizes the Django web framework with a simple front-end design to allow cataloging, managing, and querying various specimens. Potential future contributions would include the implementation of user authentication to ensure security of contributions.
